      "Answer:  Sadly, being against taking the Covid 19 vaccine will likely get one labeled as an “antivaxer”, which I am not. One should take vaccines for illness that there are no known cure for and that we otherwise have no way to defend against and that either cause death or severe disabilities and if one is at risk from it. The overwhelming majority of those who have died of Covid 19 or suffering debilitating effects after surviving it are elderly or had one or more major health problems before getting Covid. Such persons probably should get the vaccine. Others probably do not need it. I for one do not plan on getting it. I will be very angry if schools require my kids get it. Likewise, I very well may quit any job that requires I get it. If my parents choose to get it or not, that is their decision and I would support them regardless which choice they make. Regardless of what we are told, there is no such thing as a “safe” anything. Evering comes with risks and the Covid 19 vaccines are no different. There are risks. The benefits of the vaccines must outweigh the risks. For those at greater risk of death or disability from Covid 19, the benefits of getting vaccinated probably are greater the risks. For everyone else, that may not be the case. What are the risks? Of course there are risks from the vaccine itself, but there are other risks. Driving on wintery roads to and from where ever one has to go to get vaccinated is just one of many most probably do not consider. Hospitals are for sick people, as a rule healthy people should not go to a hospital. Some who are not sick with Covid will catch it at a hospital if they have to go there to get vaccinated.\n",

      "Answer:  UK18/07/21 As far as I know there are none with the provision that there will always be the odd few and I mean in the 1 in 10 or a 100.000 that for health reason either known or unknown [aphylactic shock can appear out of the blue with no previous historty] will be adversey effected by any vaccination. But the fact is that the risk of being vaccinated is ALWAYS OUTWEIGHED by the advantage of having vaccination. However since the very, very first vaccination program against SMALL POX therer have been those that have been ’agin’ it either through, and mainly RELIGIOUS objections, Ignorance a politica imperative, the usual. usual suapects who see a plot or one of the damn COMMIES under every bed. Maybe for one of the first times ever PRESIDENT MACRON of FRANCE who like POTUS is an executive President has got it right. He has made it plain that the citizens of FRANCE will be required to carry a CERTIFICATE SANITAIRE that will indicate their COVID VACCINATION status. Those that do not have the required C19 vaccination status will be barred from certain activities, employment and travel opportunities. On the first day this was announced nearly 4 million French citizens who had previously been, to varying degrees, anti-vaxxers tried to book vaccinations.\n",

      "Answer:  You’re pregnant or under 16 - the vaccines haven’t been tested in pregnant women or in children, so here in the UK we’re not vaccinating these groups. You’ve actually had COVID-19 and it was very recent (if it was more than a couple of months ago it’s worth having the vaccine as a booster). If you are prone to serious allergies of the kind which require an Epipen, you shouldn’t have the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, but Oxford/AstraZeneca and Sputnik are probably OK. There are probably some immune-system disorders which would rule it out - there are for most vaccines.\n",

      "Answer:  Look, I am not an antivaxxer, but this vaccine has not circulated long enough to say that it is safe. It normally takes years to come up with something that will work. We still don’t know enough about this virus to say it will work at all, never mind safely. So far they can’t say it will provide permanent immunity. It seems this is like the flu. Vaccine is always a year behind. People who have gotten it, could still get it again. I read that the immunity from the virus can last anywhere from a month to maybe 6 months. If this is the case, it will always be around, like the flu. So on that note. If medically, not recommended, put the more people at risk first, or are pregnant are reasons for refusing it. As for myself, undecided as of yet. My understanding is that first responders, those working in old age homes are priority (as they should be). I am content to wait and use all the precautions in place for now. I am not convinced that it is safe or protective on a larger scale. Time will tell. I would feel better if studies proved permanent immunity.\n",

      "Answer:  Ignorance. Stupidity. Religious or political fanaticism. You have a choice. Take a vaccine that has about a 1 in 100,000 chance of harming you (beyond a day or so of possible flu-like symptoms) or contact a disease that has about a 1 in 50 chance of killing you and about a 1 in 5 chance of causing long-term health damage. Doctors have found that about 20% of people who have had COVID-19 develop symptoms ranging from loss of smell and/or taste to diabetes to brain fog to disabling fatigue, among others. For people who think you will never get COVID-19, you are fooling yourselves. This virus will continue to spread and mutate, largely because of the anti-vaxxers who refuse to get their shots. You have about as much chance of not getting it over the next year or two as you would have of not getting hit by a car if you continue to run out into traffic on e freeway. Get vaccinated while you can. Once you have become infected, it is too late. I am frequently seeing people on the news who are in the hospital with COVID-19 saying they really wish they had gotten vaccianted.\n",

      "Answer:  Efficacy not proven .. unlike the efficacy of the human immune system, which is certainly well proven against Covid, shown by good margin of survival amongst healthy people. (388 healthy people only killed in U.K. during whole pandemic. ) That’s indeed why the efficacy of vaccine was not proveable.. natural resistance gets in the way of proof. Many reputable doctors say this is now a test-demic, since winter death rates are not exactly high and flu and other causes of death have vanished even as Covid has been written onto so many death certificates. The tests are a disgrace, by many accounts. Meanwhile.. evidence of asymptomatic transmission was massively over-egged. You generally have to be Ill and coughing to spread, it would now seem. Which does make sense. I don’t take medications which are not required just to make some deluded bed-wetters accept me and corrupt ones richer.\n",

      "Answer:  well, if enough peopel take it the neveryone is protected and there are limited supplies nad limited logistics and with some people it can have a much greater impact the more likely you are to catch it and spread it the more impact vaccinating you will have on the overall populationa and some people are at greter risk of dieing from the disease than others so since there’s limtied supplies if others need it more than you that’s a good reason not to take it, at least for now we should start with aretakers, doctors, elderly people, gocery store staff, etc I wouldn’t be against taking it but young people who spend most of their time at home like me are just the lowest priority and if enough people get vaccinated hte disease is goign to dwindle out anyways so if we go by priorities the pandemic will probably be over before I get some\n",

[hint - no data yet since it has been out for a whole couple of weeks]. I am one who gets a flu shot every year, have all of my vaccines without any fear but their really isn’t much data on the long term effects of the vaccine yet since it has only been out for a few weeks and personally, there isn’t much of a risk if I do get covid according to the facts from the CDC.

      "Answer:  There are valid medical reasons where someone might not be a candidate (or might need to use additional precautions) for the vaccine. Some of this is due to the fact that there isn't enough data yet to know for sure whether or not it would be safe or effective in these circumstances.History of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines or the componentsToo young (Pfizer vaccine approved for ages 16+, Moderna 18+) Additional trials may change this requirementNeutropenia (a depressed immune system related to a medical condition or treatment such as chemotherapy) There is not enough data to show whether this would be safe or effectiveHaving a positive COVID test within 90 days\n",

      "Answer:  First off all these companies Pfysier, Mordernaand Johnson and Johnson are immune from being sued and each one has so many lawsuits that they lost for other products they came out with, and none have ever produced a successful vaccine, ever. So why you you trust them. There is no raw data that proves their claims of 90–95% effectiveness.These vaccines are in the clinical trials and anyone taking them are now part of that clinical trial. VAERS ( vaccine adverse Events Report System ) claims less than 1% is actually reported and between 12/14/20 and 03/26/21 that there has been over 2,200 deaths and about 60,000 adverse reactions. That’s 1% that was reported. WebMD site claims there is evidence that cytokines storm is caused by the vaccine. Cytokines storm is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your blood stream with inflammatory protein, called cytokines. It can kill tissues and damage organs.\n",

      "Answer:  If you have legit medical condition where you had gotten negative reaction to previous vaccines that didn’t revolve around COVID19, then yes, this is a legit reason that the vaccine may not be the best course unless if your doctor gives you the green light. Anything other than that is really just based on personal choice and reasoning. Nobody can ultimately force you to take the vaccine. The only time where you can be forcibly drugged without your consent is if you pose a danger to the people around you. But usually, vaccines would never generally be a factor here though.\n",

      "Answer:  Published 12 December 2020: The public, much of it, seems to be confused about what has happened with Covid-19 vaccines and what is about to happen. Let me say at the outset that no member of the public in the USA can legally be inoculated with any Covid vaccine. No one is required to take a vaccine that hasn't been approved even if they want it. The FDA has issued an EUA (emergency use authorization) for the Pfizer vaccine. Emergency use is not the same as approval. The Pfizer vaccine seems to be protective against severe disease. No evidence for viral sterilization has been presented. What it means is that people who are inoculated can still become infected but the virus will find it more difficult to get inside their cells to produce severe disease. It seems likely that inoculated, infected people will be able to continue to spread the disease. The consequence is that any idea of \"herd\" immunity is myth. For symptomatic disease to go away, everyone will have to be vaccinated. Anyone not inoculated will eventually become infected and risk a virulent immune response that could injure or kill them. The disease will continue to rage out of control possibly forever but 95% of the victims will be asymptomatic after the entire population is vaccinated. Anyone not vaccinated will have no protection against more virulent natural encounters which will leave the survivors with an immunity that is 15% effective, according to data currently available. 15% is not much compared to the 95% that can be gained by vaccination. The situation that we are currently facing is dire and civilization-changing. Nothing we have in our tool kit right now is going to change the necessity to continue to mask and social distance. The reason is that vaccinated people will continue to be periodically reinfected. 19 out of 20 times they won't notice. One of the 20 infections will make them mildly symptomatic. Unvaccinated people will continue to suffer injuries and 3% of the unvaccinated will die after each wave of infections. The public is not going to be vaccinated until FDA approvals are issued. The earliest the approvals can come is late April 2021. The good news is that new vaccines are in the pipeline. Some of them might provide sterilizing immunity. When and if sterilizing immunity becomes a thing, the Covid-19 nightmare will be over. It won't be known until this time next year how much risk, if any, the Pfizer vaccine imposes on large, diverse populations. We are going to learn as we go. Screw-ups are going to occur. They always do when new vaccines are introduced. Nevertheless, the safety trials thus far are reassuring. The Pfizer vaccine seems to be miraculously protective. It is probably because very few people got infected during the trials—not in the vaccinated group certainly, but also not in the placebo group either. Most experts want to see more data over a longer period of time. It might turn out that the vaccine is more protective than the data shows but it could be less. More data will shrink uncertainty. The following TWIV video of experts talking is long but current and understandable. The issue of the apparent absence of evidence for sterilizing immunity is discussed at 27 minutes and again at 1 hour and 27 minutes. Times are approximate and span about 5 minutes each, give or take. VAX TO THE FUTURE\n",

      "Answer:  No I wont be getting the vaccine. Many good points made here I will try to keep it brief.I had Covid it was mild and worst was loosing my sense of snell which has recovered-I know for some it doesn’t go so easy but there are ways to treat the infections with hydrocloroquone, invermectin, redemsivir, monoclonal antibodies ,covalescent plasma corticosteroids and antibiotics.The mRNA and viral vector technology has never been tested on humnas before. Ling term side effects are unknown and wont be known for years-everyone and ho takes it becomes a test subject. The technology on itself has been around for 30+years and leads to the question if its so safe and effective why it hasn’t been used on humans before.As a researcher I become completely disillusioned about the priorities that academia and Pharma industry has in mind-its all about the money. Results have been are and will be manipulated/hidden completely if it will cost the life of a certain project/drug-look up the story of Vioxx. I also have recognized how incredibly limiting the current reductionist approach is and how little we as scientists know about the body. The experiments we design are flawed no matter how much we try not to. Take a look at the story of thalidomide.Previous animal studies on developing vaccines for SARS Cov1 has led to the so called pathogen priming where the immune system gets overstimulated once exposed to the wild virus post vaccination and results in a much more severe disease instead of less severe. This phenomenon is also being observed in people who have been re-infected and ended up getting a more severe case of disease after second exposure.A new reprint shows that people who are testing positive for Covid ling after disease has resolved have pieces if viral DNA inserted into the human genome. This happens with variety of viruses like herpes or varicella. And it launches the questions can this happen as well with the mRNA and DNA from the vaccine especially if this becomes a yearly shot. Chances are low but not impossible.Another study showed people with long Covid symptoms had an improvement in symptoms after the vaccination. Very peculiar finding. Hyphotesis suggest either presence of the virus in low enough amount not to be detected by PCR but still causing symptoms (in my opinion contradictory statements) and the immune system no longer responding to it. So the vaccine provides extra boost to clear the virus. Second is some sort of autoimmunity and the vaccine somehow restoring the balance of the immune system. Normally when I person develops an autoimmune response due the certain trigger once it encounters the trigger the autoimmune response will get worse. However when dealing with pollen allergies there is desensitization therapy where you introduce small amounts of pollen and gradually drops increase the amount over a long period of time to stop the immune system from responding to it. This phenomenon very much reminds me of that desensitization therapy where the vaccine is actually serving as modulator and telling the immune system to stop responding to the coronavirus spike protein. What can be the implication of this happening is anybody’s guess but most probably these individuals will be highly susceptible to the virus and will not mount a proper immune response in the future.Any assurance of the government and Pharma that these vaccines wont cause autoimmunity or infertility is simply a misinformation cause the vaccine has not been tested long enough for such possible side effects to appear. There has been report on sudden onset of autoimmune reaction which if course was ruled accidental and not connected to the vaccine.The shot does not prevent infection or spread of the virus it only leads to a milder case of Covid in most people. As I mentioned before due to pathogen priming some unlucky ones may end up with a much severe case because of their hyper activation of the immune system.I can provide links to credible articles for anyone interested on the topic.UPDATE: now apparently some people are developing shingles shortly after vaccination which is very concerning. The herpes zoster virus or varicella is a virus that insert its genome into our cells and usually gets re-activated later in life due to heavy stress and lowered immune system. If the vaccine is triggering one or both of those events this is really not good news for anybody’s health. There has been reports of women getting incredibly heavy periods after vaccination as well as menopausal women getting periods years after they stopped-this is also quite concerning cause it may point that the vaccine is indeed having some sort of effects on the female reproductive system or causes imbalances in female hormones. I am sure more side effects will be coming out.Adding an article that has links to all the articles that I mention and then some. Also links provided to the Pfizer and Moderna FDA emergency use authorization approval submission where you can read all the “science” or lack of it.Another very interesting article about the origin of the SARS Cov2 and what may have been the role of the experts like Fauci in the pandemic. Its long but very much worth the time. And if someone has missed Faucis leaked emails please find them and read them. Does anyone still foolishly believe this virus was not man-made and the experts have “your best interest” in mind?!?!Another double standard and made up science-if a person has had Covid and recovered and looses antibodies he is no longer considered “immune” but when it comes to vaccinated individuals lets not check for antibodies at all?!?! And how are antibodies produced against 29 viral proteins (this is how much the whole virus has) and viral RNA WORSE then antibodies produced against ONE protein-the Spike protein that the vaccine encodes?Lets add myocarditis to the growing list of side effects in young adults 16–24years of age. No surprise there and the kist will simply keep grwoing since recent findings show the mRNA does not stay at the injection site but travels trough out the whole body ( Pfizer bio distribution studies) and tends to accumulate in the spleen and ovaries. Yet it certainly wont affect your fertility the “experts” said.Antibody Test Not Useful to Prove Immunity Among Vaccinated: FDA The origin of COVID: Did people or nature open Pandora’s box at Wuhan? - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 18 Reasons I Won't Be Getting a Covid Vaccine https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561/leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3lxGGyapvysr69fTX2xTutVOvZJzhF9Z-4Z48TrCwjsMMLizOn7axl0vM Vaccine researcher admits ‘big mistake,’ says spike protein is dangerous ‘toxin’\n",

      "Answer:  Well that's your decision but dont make that stupid decision and do like everyone else and get the vaccine….. I dont care what people say about vaccines they do work…… when I was a kid I had all those vaccines that people swear up and down now are all bad but I turned out good and every other child I grew up with turned out the same way I did……. This is the way I'm gonna be once the vaccine comes out is that if somebody dont get the vaccine dont come within ten feet of me and u will not be allowed in my house……. Everybody wants a cure for the virus and once they start talking about a vaccine to prevent people from getting it the same ones that wanted a vaccine in the first place says that they want get it……. I mean make up your damn mind which one u want…… when will people start taking this virus seriously????? If u dont think its not that serious than look at the people who has had it in america and how many that has died from it….. the numbers are absolutely terrifying……. And some of u want to blame our leaders why the rea6it spreading like it is, u do know it's people like u is the reason its spreading like wildfire u are blame cause u want take precautions to stop the spread……. So quit blaming our leaders and take a good look in the mirror and u will see who is to blame and it's the person looking back at u…… and u wonder why we are the laughing stock around the world right now it ain't because of our leaders its because of people like u……. That are walking around not social distancing not wearing mask or anything and acting like u have no care in the world…… and the sad part of it is most of you have kids at home some that are very young and u could care less……. Cause if u did u would at least take the precautions with your kids to keep them from getting it……. If u ain't gonna vaccine your kids once it comes out then dont send your kids to school to infect everyone else……homeschool them….. cause if your kid gives my nieces or nephews that virus and they die their death will be on your hands not nobody else's… I mean what kind of parent dont vaccinate their kids from deadly diseases especially this one…….. yes u are the parent and I have to make their decision and speak up for them but they are their own human too and has their rights just like us adults do……\n",

VAERS ID: 914621-1, 89yo Resident in our long term care facility who received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 12/22/2020, only documented side effect was mild fatigue after receiving. She passed away on 12/27/2020 of natural causes per report. Has previously been in & out of hospice care, resided in nursing home for 9+ years, elderly with dementia. Due to proximity of vaccination we felt we should report the death, even though it is not believed to be related.

      "Answer:  Covid-19 Vaccine:COVID-19 vaccine is finally here and, you can say the wait is over. No, matter how much we cover our faces and wash hands frequently, we need a vaccine to fight this pandemic. But wait, do you know about the results, side effects, and precautions of the most awaited vaccines? The trials of the vaccine have already started. But, before taking a vaccine, one should know everything about it. The first question people have – is the vaccine safe? Let’s know about the vaccine in detail. Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?The primary concern is whether it is safe to take the COVID-19 vaccine or not. The objective of the world vaccine system is to ensure that all the vaccines are safe and effective. Safety is indeed the priority while manufacturing the vaccine. Trial and Testing – All the vaccines go under testing to test the effectiveness and safety. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set up standards to know about vaccine safety. According to the National Institute of Health, one vaccine should pass the four phases before it is used, for the public. As per the UK for the Pfizer-BioNTech, almost 40,000 volunteers were hired by the government for the trial. Half of the people have given the vaccine and the other half placebo jab. Authorization – In the United States, FDA approved vaccines can be released in 1 public for emergency use authorization. The EUA gives temporary allowance to use vaccines in emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. Monitoring the Results and Side-Effects – The government has asked all the vaccine manufactured companies to keep track of the results of the vaccine. There might be side effects that did not get noticed during the trials. FDA and CDC are expanding their vaccine monitoring work so they can find the side-effects and results early. How Effective are the COVID-19 Vaccines?It’s natural to wonder if the vaccines against the coronavirus are effective or not. The overall effectiveness report of the vaccines is 75% to 95%.Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine trial involves almost 44,000 people. The vaccine is 95% effective and authorized to use in the United States.Moderna Vaccine trial involves 30,000 volunteers and is 94% effective. It is allowed to be used in the US.AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine trial showed 70% results on the usage of the full dose. However, it showed 90% results on using a half dose. This vaccine is allowed to be used for Great Britain.Johnsson and Jhonson vaccine trial has experienced 66% effectiveness and wants authorization for the US.Final Words! People are concerned and scared before taking the COVID-19 vaccination. The primary concern is whether the COVID-19 vaccine is safe or not. Many rumors are spreading out there related to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Before believing anything blindly, one should check all the facts. However, different vaccines are under development and ready for trial. I hope this year we will kill this coronavirus. For more health-related information, follow Health Club Finder.

      "Answer:  No, I will not be getting any of them. Why?Because science isn’t scared of questions, lies are. Every time someone questions these products people get emotional, this is a sign of irrational thinking. This is a red flag for me.I don’t base my decisions on fear.Because of the conflict of interest from the people who are recommending it. If you stand to make millions from your advice, I don’t trust your advice is unbiased.Because I can read and I used my reading skills to read the fact sheet and the studies that show the “efficacy.” I was not impressed.It doesn’t prevent infection, sars-coV-2.I’m not at a high risk nor do I put anyone else at risk because essentially the best the vaccine can do is turn people into “asymptomatic spreaders”.There is enough research to show “asymptomatic spreading” does not happen. I’ve provided research a thousand times but people are going to listen to whoever they deem to be their “authority” regardless of what the data shows.The track record of the manufacturers is atrocious. They have paid billions in damages and falsifying trial data.Zero liability times two. Emergency Use Authorization + 1986.Animal trials with the previous mRNA vaccines all ended with the animals dying from exposure to the ‘wild virus’.Previous bad experience with vaccinesMany pro-vaccine scientists are throwing their careers away to warn people not to take any of the vaccines. This is a red flag for me.I don’t subscribe to germ theory. Terrain theory makes more sense.There are plenty of effective and safe treatment protocols, all of them have been ignored by the CDC and WHO.Because it leads to vaccine passports and medical apartheid/segregation. I do not approve of segregation and my prayers go out to Israel who’s government sold its citizens to Pfizer.Because I understand the immune system and how viruses can be stopped naturally and in the worst-case scenario I’d go to the proven treatments which are mostly natural anyway.Because the pandemic is propped up by PCR tests. The inventor said PCR tests are incapable of diagnosing anything.Because the government lies about just about anything as long as they get more power over the citizens that it is supposed to work for.7/16 Update: Thanks for the love and support and even the respectful disagreements! I believe in open debate and discussion. Clearly, a year ago this kind of opinion was hard to find, and mostly ignored or hated, but now the tide is turning and people are seeing the corruption from our governments. When millions listen to a select few instead of deciding what’s best for themselves, they pay for every mistake those select few make. Autonomy is always the best solution. 19. Because it has the most adverse event reports of any vaccine in history combined. It is illegal to falsify reports so, chances are they are legitimate since most people are not willing to risk legal repercussions to fill out a form. I do not believe in 438,440 coincidences as of 7/7/2021. 9,048 reported deaths after injection. 20. Because it is being promoted with threats of being terminated, segregation, money, lottery, scholarships, it is promoted to children, without the consent of the parents, with ice cream. Literally, someone paid strangers with candy to lure kids into getting an experimental shot that they statistically don’t need and the manufacturers are exempt from liability and once again the parents do not have to be notified. 21. Dr. Robert Malone is the inventor of mRNA Vaccine technology, he calls some of the vaccines gene therapy. My genes are fine the way they are. Hundreds of Pages of Helpful Resources to Read and Share: US VAERS counts:COVID Vaccine LandingVAERS_ID: 1141993 AGE: 19 At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.https://www.openvaers.com/covid-dataFauci’s FOIA Emails:ICAN Fauci Emails_2021_06_03More sharing options Copy file link to clipboard Save file to My Files Get ad free downloads and 1 TB of space.

      "Answer:  It’s Not a vaccine and it is the most dangerous of any vaccine ever used with a logged death rate over 1000% higher than any previously approved vaccine. They are only using it to keep the economy open from total collapse, by people too afraid to leave their homes. If 1 in 1000 people died or because permanently disabled form it, they deam it still worth it. Most Republicans are not in fear over covid, not hiding at home etc (thus the whole mask issue). Most Dems are, and believe the news and do not have access to the data. Technically, it’s a genetic experimental treatment.You are asking a question that has inaccurately made a statement. Taking tha vaccine has caused many thousands of deaths. In the US alone , the cdc has verified about 6,000. It is believed that 6k is about 1% of the actual deaths, because most reported deaths are not being approved as proven covid vax deaths And many are not reported to vaers (the cdc death and disability vax accounting system). Many shots were given by cvs workers and other non drs. When the patients died a few days later, the hospital/morgue receives the body and marks it as heart attack (the ones with heart inflamation called myocarditis), or stroke (the ones who’s blood vessel in brain pops/aneurysm). The third percentage usually died from full body inflamation or lung inflamation/suffocation. The receiving hospital and morge doesn’t list it or report it as a covid vax death unless a close relative comes to identify the body And puts two and two together, And knows when they got the shot, And is willing to admit the shot caused their death, And then it gets reported to vaers, And vaers decides if it’s going to be counted in the death tally by approving it as a proven vax death. Most Dems are in denial. My father got shingles from the shot and wouldn’t report it, denial. My friends parents both were found dead 7 days after they had the shot on the same day. It was reported to vaers but not approved or counted as a shot vax death because they said there was no proof that a stroke seven days later would be caused by the vax. It is statistically impossible for two people to die from a stroke on the same day, exactly 7 days after a vax ( that is known to cause blood clots inflamation and strokes). Another lady I know, her mom died a few days after the shot. Her mom was about 65 and had gotten covid and recovered a month earlier. I have seen much data suggesting people who get covid after shot one, near the time of their shot like within a few months, or a month after, get an exaggerated inflammation reaction and die from that. So, I know 3 dead from the shot & yet zero dead from covid.remeber these are all considered experiments. It has never been shown that these reduce the likelihood of covid, (over half of all new cases are fully vaxed people). The changes to you are permanent and pass down to all your future children. Why risk destroying human genetics just due to irrational fear? Most people who get covid won’t even know it because their immune system just kills it before they get any symptoms. Only elderly and people with compromised immune systems (usually with inflammatory immunocompromised people mainly) get symptoms and realize they have covid. Now thought people that had the shot, their systems for the yfirst tube are having a huge reaction and they are getting sick and symptoms form covid. The highest death rate during all months of covid, in Israel, (the month they vaxxed over half of all citizens) was the month they gave their citizens the genetic expiramebtal vax. That shows all deaths not just approved deaths. Therefore they now know more deaths are caused by the vax then covid itself. There are multiple lawsuits now.there is no reason for an informed person to risk their life with the vax and future health when drs now know exactly how to treat covid, the hospitals are empty, there is no longer a concern as we now know what to do. There are excellent home treatments that cure most and beyond that for the fragile immunocompromised the hospital know exactly what to do to keep their patients cured. It’s Not a ventalator! Those caused much death.the companies who made the vax put billions of dollars on the line to produce these shots yet now nobody wants them. So, there are massive propaganda campaigns to convince people to take them. The news tells people, who are dumb enough to believe everything they hear …even from kids on tv that are told what to tell people by their company owners….that the shot saves and people not taking it are stupid and killers who they should hate. They are offering people money and gifts. They are lying and putting reports out that many people or more than half of people are taking the shot. That’s not at all true. Have you seen the graduation videos from a u I eristy showing the section with 10k empty chaira for the vaxxed families and 10k full chairs for the unvacxed families? There is a ton of actual proven data that proves to me less than 32% of the population has taken the shot.why would anyone trust their life and health (even 1200 kids young bits died this month from heart inflamation after taking the shot) and remember those are just the Reported numbers And accepted reports. The cdc even changed vaers reporting system several months tha ago and told drs it was no longer advised or necessary to report any covid vax deaths to the cdc vaers reporting system. They gave the explanation that they originally just wanted to see what the nyne ta would show and they have their data and don’t need anymore. This has made drs aware of the cdcs fraud and coverup of the the deaths and over 600,000 cases of disability and Er reactions like heart attack stroke paralysis. Drs are the largest group who refuse the shot. cdc officials, government officials, military are all the second largest groups to nit take the genetic experiment. what does that tell you? That the most informed individuals won’t take it and the least informed do.dems are considered the least informed individuals. There have been studies that show this. Apparently they believe what they are told in the tv. They did pills and surveys asking people that regularly watch the tv and tv news like msnbc Cbs cnn numerous question. Such as how many black deaths by police occur on average each year? (Pre Biden when deaths have soared) They would answer somthing like 1,000. Republicans answered more correctly with something like 200. The ave for the last five years is 240. Police had shot twice as many white people. Dems gave the number for white as 25. Republicans gave the number 300. These stats are similar accross all subjects. The Dems tended to give answers that were inline with the propaganda from tv. While Republicans gave closer responses true to the data. They cited their news sources as several sources not on tv and research. Ask any Republican stats on the “vaccines” and they will be likely I nformed. And any dem and they will parrot what the tv propaganda says. They will say there’s so few deaths they barely count as millions got the shot and it’s all that will save us we will all die from covid and the vaccine saves us it’s safe and great and people who won’t take it we should judge and hate and are stupid people who believe crazy conspiracy theories. That’s the propaganda on the tv regarding all subjects.Most people not taking the genetic experimental shot either work in medicine and have seen the death, heart attacks, strokes, paralysis, etc from the shots. Or, they know someone who died from the vax. Often they don’t even know anyone who died from covid. They got covid already and it was no worse than a cold for them, so why risk their life. They already have the antibodies which actually work and show up, yet the vax doesn’t provide people antibodies that show up on tests. Or they just have the facts and don’t see any need to permanently change their health, with an expirament that has never shown safety or benefit. The only animal test done left the animals dead. The companies all requested that there be no way to sue the for deaths in all countries before being willing to offer their shots.\n",

      "Answer:  Contrary to all the answers so far, it may not be related to menopause directly and in fact may actually be related to the vaccine. And no, I’m not an anti-vaxxer or anything like that. There is apparently a known correlation between vaccinations and irregular menses for a few months. About 25% of women report such an impact.

      "Answer:  ORIGINAL QUESTION: Is the Covid vaccine proved safe? I am not an anti-vaxxer. I just have concerns because of how fast it was pushed through. I keep thinking about thalidomide.Thalidomide was fully and properly tested over a number of years, according to the standards of the time. It is still used to treat cancers, leprosy, and tuberculosis, and is helpful in avoiding rejection of transplant organs, stem cells and bone marrow. The problem with thalidomide is that, LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER DRUG IN EXISTENCE, it should NEVER BE GIVEN TO PREGNANT WOMEN. Most of the time that drug development takes is LOST TIME. It is time when NOTHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS. It’s taken up with admin and money-grubbing, NOT RESEARCHING OR TESTING.The ACTUAL research, for vaccines, takes weeks, not years.The ACTUAL testing takes months, not years.And the only reason that Stage 1, 2 and 3 trials aren’t normally run concurrently is because of LACK OF MONEY.With COVID-19,most of the 100-odd vaccines were created within 6 weeks of the coronavirus genome being released.the tests took months, partly because so many people signed up to take part, and partly because…the trials were run concurrently thanks to governments THROWING TRUCKLOADS OF MONEY AT scientists with vaccine candidates.This is how scientific research COULD be done, if there wasn’t so much TIME WASTED. Signed, A research manager who chopped 3 months off the money-grubbing - I mean, funding application exercise - by using EMAIL instead of snail-mail. Because I fecking HATE wasted time.\n",

      "Answer:  That depends on what you call ‘safe’. I’ve worked in medicine for a bit over a decade now. Not terribly long, but perhaps long enough to notice a couple of patterns. Rare complications attract attention, and are magnified in terms of their relevance as a result. My favourite example of this tendency is the awareness of Guillain-Barré syndrome as a consequence of influenza vaccines. The Hazard Ratio for the development of this condition in one of the few studies that suggests an actual increased risk with vaccination is 1.11 (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.51-2.43).That sounds bad, right? Yet the Hazard Ratio for Guillain-Barré syndrome as a consequence of catching seasonal influenza is 4.89 (95% CI: 1.17-20.36). Yep, ‘getting flu naturally’ confers a level of risk more than four times higher. Perhaps even more interestingly, a Finnish study showed that having surgery increased the relative risk (technically not the same measure as a hazard ratio, which is a time-related incidence) of Guillain-Barré syndrome within the first 6 weeks after the procedure by 13-fold (95% CI: 5.68-30.3, P ≤ 0.0001). Hence, the real risk of this awful neurological condition is much higher with naturally-acquired influenza and very much higher with procedures where we wouldn’t usually think of it (but which cause inflammatory consequences associated with demyelination) in comparison to influenza vaccination. Vaccines provoke immunological defense mechanisms. I’ve had a lot of them. Sometimes I feel a bit malaised for a couple of days as my system responds as if I had been infected. To me that’s not really an ‘adverse event’ - that’s how the body works. Nature is not nice, so are we surprised when something that is somewhat similar to a dangerous pathogen drives our defences into battle-mode? That’s literally the idea. Preparation is so much better than ambush, as anyone who’s ever answered a Batphone in an Emergency department knows. (As an aside, one of my medical school friends who did some time as an ICU registrar had the surname Batman. We never got sick of him picking up the Batphone with ‘this is Dr Batman’. In summary, as I said to a friend this morning, the Australian distribution of Oxford’s vaccine will go into my arm and those of my family as soon as it is provided to us. Like every other recommended immunisation, according to appropriate guidelines. I take bigger risks driving a car or surfing. In fact, pretty much everything I’m insured for is less safe. That’s why we have insurance, after all, because nothing is safe. There are only relative measures of how dangerous things are, of which something like drinking alcohol is nearly incomparable in its effect to much more famous complications. But we like alcohol, despite it being almost the perfect poison. It’s so small! It’s just a carbohydrate, for crying out loud!https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268577241_Why_does_society_accept_a_higher_risk_for_alcohol_than_for_other_voluntary_risks\n",

      "Answer:  In the US, only one vaccine has been approved (as of the moment I am writing this). “The most commonly reported side effects, which typically lasted several days, were pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. Of note, more people experienced these side effects after the second dose than after the first dose, so it is important for vaccination providers and recipients to expect that there may be some side effects after either dose, but even more so after the second dose.” Obviously, if you have allergies, you should check the list of actual ingredients, just to ensure you do not have an allergy to any of the ingredients. However, the formula was deliberately chosen to avoid any of the more common allergies that humans tend to exhibit. If fact, it is very, very rare that anyone is allergic to any of the ingredients, and that was by design. List of all ingredients: mRNA, lipids ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate); 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide:1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine, and cholesterol);potassium chloride; monobasic potassium phosphate; sodium chloride; dibasic sodium phosphate; dihydrate; sucrose. People who have allergies to foods, animals, insects, latex, and other common allergies can be vaccinated. Likewise, people with allergies to oral drugs, even if they are the oral equivalent to an injectable drug, can take the vaccine, the CDC guidance said. Included in this group are people who have had a non-serious allergic reaction to an injection — though not anaphylaxis — and people who have a family history of anaphylaxis, but who have not experienced it themselves. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine or an injectable therapy can be vaccinated, but with caution. These people should undergo a risk assessment with their care provider.

      "Answer:  Most of the countries are creating vaccines to overcome the current pandemic situation. The topmost priority aligned with this vaccine creation is “Safety”. Even manufacturers are ensuring that COVID-19 vaccinations are safe enough to use and have minor-to-no side effects.Moreover, vaccine safety is a key interest at WHO and it’s effectively collaborating with the national authorities to curate and implement robust standards to establish a platform representing safer vaccinations. Let’s have a look at how different COVID-19 vaccinations ensure top-notch safety.Expert Analysis - WHO has appointed an external expert panel that analyzes responses to clinical trials and suggests how the vaccines are to be used accordingly.mRNA Vaccine Technology - This technology is being studied for over a decade now and the different mRNA vaccines are rigorously assessed via necessary clinical trials.Randomized Trials - The vaccines are tested in comprehensive randomized controlled trials including medical conditions, ethnicities, age, gender, frailty, pregnancy, etc.Scientific Collaboration - All the research, planning, developement, authorization, and distribution of different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is backed by scientific collaboration.Consistent Monitoring - WHO is working with health officials, vaccine manufacturers, and all the other clinical partners and tracking the safety concerns of vaccines in real-time.Funding for Development - Governments all over the world are making no compromises when spending on vaccine-related tests to ensure their effectiveness and complete safety.All the above points are making it successful for millions of people to safely receive coronavirus vaccines. It can be said that these multi-stage development processes, quality testing facilities, and large clinical trials are the reason for safer vaccinations. Besides, with the day-by-day R&D advancements, in coming times this specifically designed vaccination framework shall identify safety concerns more effectively and help the globe in achieving normality.\n",

      "Answer:  Yes. My mother is being vaccinated tomorrow. I and ecstatic about it. One of the reasons it normally takes years to develop a vaccine is because they do everything in sequence. They find a candidate, then ask for funding to do small scale animal testing. Then write up the results and publish it. Then they ask for funding for safety testing in a small group of humans. Then they do the testing. Then they write it up and publish the results. Then they ask for funding for a study in hundreds of humans. Then they do the testing. Then they write it up and publish the results. Then they ask for funding for testing in tens of thousands of humans. Then they try to find somebody to make a hundred thousand doses of the vaccine. Then they do the test. Then they write it up and publish the results. Then they ask for a license for it. Only then do they try to find somebody to make millions or billions of doses. That’s why it normally takes years. For covid-19 vaccines the good candidates got promises of funding while they were still doing the animal studies. They got hundreds of thousands of doses made when they started small human studies. They didn’t have to spend a year, or more, trying to find funding for each phase. Indeed, they didn’t wait for one phase to finish before starting another. Once animal studies and small-scale human trials had shown it to be very likely safe, then they started doing the intermediate-scale and large-scale studies are the same time. So they’ve spent as much time on each phase of testing as they would have done before. But they’ve not wasted time between each phase. That’s how they’ve cut the development time down so drastically. When people talk of long term safety testing they are probably referring to Phase IV testing. Phase I is safety testing in small numbers of volunteers. Phase II is testing for efficacy in a few hundred volunteers. Phase III tests for safety and efficacy bin tens of thousands. Phase IV is done in much larger numbers - of real patients, after the drug/vaccine has been licensed. In this case civid-19 vaccines are being tested in exactly the same way as other vaccines. Phase IV testing goes on for years. The other reason this vaccine was faster than any other is genetic biology. In the past a vaccine candidate would have to be made by trying to inactivate a live virus, or bits of a virus. It was very much trial and error. In January 2020 the Chinese emailed the RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 around the world. Three hours later one researcher had already developed a vaccine candidate based on the spike protein. Three hours for a process that used to take years! Anti-vaxxers are invited to post their pro-plague rants as separate answers. Comments along those lines will be deleted.\n",

      "Answer:  All of the available data points to it being very safe. All vaccines, all medicine, and everything that gets into our bodies, carry risks of adverse effects and side effects. These vaccines do carry risks, just no more risk than any other vaccine, and less than many. So far, it sounds like feeling a little sick for a day or two is the most common reaction. That's perfectly normal, and just means your body is mounting an immune response, which is the whole point of a vaccine. The mRNA vaccines started development during the ebola outbreaks, so the technology is not THAT new, and it has been tested. For the COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine contains the spike proteins that the SARS-Cov-2 virus uses to bind to cells. No actual virus is in the vaccine. Traditional vaccines use killed or weakened live virus at a dose low enough that your body won't become infected, but high enough to elicit an immune response so your body creates antibodies. The mRNA technology allows them to use only the spike protein, with no actual virus in the vaccine at all. That means you can't possibly get COVID-19 from a vaccine. This means they just had to find a dose high enough to get your body to make antibodies. The risk of infection is gone. Once you read up a little on what an MRNA vaccine actually is, it stops being so scary. The technology is absolutely amazing, and a discovery-to-vaccine time of less than a year is practically miraculous. It will be the new standard for vaccines in the future. Is there a chance there's some zombie-creating reaction possible in the public that was covered up or unnoticed in trials? Yeah, I guess it's possible. It's not like big pharma has any qualms with lying. I get the mistrust. But not only are there a very small amount of reactions in the US, there are very few reaction being reported anywhere. Not using a dead or live virus, just the spike protein, seems to me like it would be safer, for a wider array of people, than virus-bearing vaccines.\n",

      "Answer:  Unknown. The developers will likely provide their research results when they are ready for use. And there will likely be dozens of different vaccine types in 2021. When a vaccine is available for you then you should talk to your doctor as he/she should have the information needed. And you will not be forced to take the vaccine. Many people are scared of vaccines. And many have very strong views on the subject. Vaccines will not be made available until governments get the full results of largescale human testing. And there will always be some risks. Just like many medications that are commonly used today. Political and economic pressure may push governments to take excessive risks with vaccines. President 45 is happy for vaccines to be approved but that does not mean he will take one himself. And if President Biden approves vaccines it is likely that President 45 will say they are unsafe. He wants the credit for making the vaccine himself. This anti-vaccine movement is worse in the US than many other countries. Possibly due to poor health and history education in the US.\n",

Those warning of dangers are spreading their own, probably perfectly honest, unsubstantiated fears. However dangerous the vaccine may be, not having the vaccine is very, very dangerous. In my opinion, having the vaccine is at least 1,000 times safer than not having it. And with odds like that, even a non gambler knows which way to bet.\n",

Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of this topic with balk off an answer, because there is no such thing as a “COVID-19 vaccine” (COVID-19 is a symptom cluster, not an illness, the virus we vaccinate against is called SARS-CoV-2) and because the safety of vaccines in general is established well beyond this question. Right now, a number of different vaccines are either licensed or in Phase 3 and per emergency licensure allowed for public use. The two licensed vaccines are RI vector vaccines, while Phase III has a number of inactivated, RI vector, and RC vector vaccines. Additionally, two RNA vaccines are also under emergency licensure. Each of those vaccines is “safe” from a “harms the recipient” standpoint. Some of those vaccines are of questionable efficacy in old, obese, and some other groups. But “safe”? They all are.

      "Answer:  A genetic question deserves a generic answer. There are potentially 150–180 vaccines available not just one as is implied in the question. They use different techniques in their production, they are then tested with increasing numbers of subjects which indicate the level of trust in the candidate. At phase 3 there are upwards of 30,000 subjects involved, if even one gets ill unexpectedly the trial is halted until an independent investigation confirms the cause if it is due to the vaccine candidate the whole trial is cancelled. The trial ar phase 3 is conducted across several countries to test on as many ethnic mixes as possible. The phase 3 trail has a well defined endpoint and there are internal checks were reports are produced it may be possible to apply for an emergency authority for use which will allow thenbsccine to be given to the public while the long term effects are studied. so the short term effects of a vaccine are geared to it being very safe , but with the compressed time scales there is a very small risk that long term effects might show up in some years time. But the volunteers for the trial are still being monitored until at least the middle of next year. To pick up such rare event.\n",

      "Answer:  We don’t have a vaccine yet. The reason we do phase 3 trials on many people is to determine the safety of new medical approaches in a large enough population that we can be assured of their safety and efficacy. We are likely to push through a vaccine in record time. It is quite concerning however that there is a great deal of political pressure being put on the FDA to approve various treatments and vaccines prior to the November 3 election for political reasons. This is something to monitor very carefully and I would not take a vaccine that had not gone through appropriate testing. It is possible that members of the FDA could be dismissed and political appointees put in their place in order to expedite this.

      "Answer:  At this point, there aren't any vaccines that have been through the full normal levels of testing, though Russia has released one for wider use than usual without that. There are some Phase 3 trials going. At that stage, there has been enough testing that they can rule out common bad side effects, but rarer ones are possible. That's one of the things they are looking for. Earlier phases are riskier, though they will have done what they can to exclude them. By the time the vaccine is released, they will have evidence that the vaccine helps far more than it hurts. That's what the testing is for. Very rare or long term negative results are still possible. Those are more likely for something you have to take repeatedly.\n",

      "Answer:  The United States has approved two vaccines within a week for emergency medical use to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The country with the highest death toll from the pandemic initially approved vaccines made by Pfizer and BioNtech. Then on Friday, the country approved the Moderna's Covid Vaccine.Side effects No severe long-term side effects were observed during the large-scale trial of both vaccines. However, a few short-term side effects have been observed. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, were not compared directly. According to trials, Moderna vaccine has a slightly higher side effect. Symptoms of fatigue, headache, and fever may appear on the first day or second day after the second dose of vaccine. This symptom is more common in people under 65 years of age. The Pfizer vaccine did not cause any side effects in humans. However, in the United States and the United Kingdom, severe allergies have been reported in some cases as a side effect since the introduction of the vaccine. Two in the UK and a health worker in Alaska have spoken of allergies after being vaccinated by Pfizer. The UK Drug Enforcement Administration recommends that people with anaphylaxis or severe allergies to certain foods or drugs not be vaccinated.

      "Answer:  I’ve given this issue a lot of thought and I do believe that with the information currently available the vaccines are safe. To be clear, there is no long term data on the vaccines. We do not know what the side effects of the vaccine could be years/decades from now. This is especially true since this method of vaccine creation is novel. So like anything in life there is a certain amount of risk. You don’t know what could happen. The thing is, however, there is no evidence to suggest something bad could happen. You can spend your entire life wondering “what if” about every possible decision. Should I drive across a bridge to get to work today? In theory, we don’t know that the bridge will hold. It is possible you driving over that bridge could cause it collapse. However, engineers constructed that bridge using established principles and based upon the data we have so far that bridge isn’t going to collapse. Yet bridges can and do collapse. New bridges, constructed in ways, have collapsed because there were factors unaccounted for in the theory used to design the bridge. The example I’m thinking of involves resonance, but that’s a topic for another time. However, to be clear, there are also unknowns and risks to Covid itself. Quite a list in fact:It has a higher mortality rate than the flu.Young people can and do get sick from it.Some people have symptoms that persist for monthsIt causes inflammation in the brain similar to that caused by diseases like Parkinson’s.There are no longer term studies done to show the effects of Covid on a human either. Is it possible that getting Covid in your 30’s could lead to an increase rate of dementia in your later years? Could it cause future problems with your lungs or other brain related problems? Ask people who have had the chicken pox. You have it once as a child and it goes away. It resurfaces later in life as shingles. I had shingles when I was 29. It sucks. Imagine having it when you’re 80. Just like the vaccine, getting Covid comes with a certain amount of risks. Your duty as an informed individual is to decide which set of risks you’re okay with. If you…have no history of allergic reactions to vaccineshave no history of anaphylaxis.have a job that requires you to be around peopleI think it’s pretty clear there is less risk in just getting the vaccine. Twice. Make sure you take it twice, because after the first dose the antibodies will decline in your system over time. It takes two doses to produce enough antibodies that persist to grant you the protective effects of the vaccine. For those of you who are unsure, this vaccine does not inject you with any form of the virus. An mRNA vaccine injects you with a molecule which triggers your cells to produce a specific protein which mimics the shape of the covid virus. In specific, it creates the spiked “corona” part of the virus. Using this your body learns how to deal with the virus. Unfortunately, we live in a world where there are no perfect choices. Some choices are objectively better than others though. Get the vaccine.\n",

      "Answer:  I think the covid 19 vaccine is safe to use. It is a mRNA vaccine . Generally , mRNA stands for messenger RNA vaccine . A mRNA vaccine is a vaccine which uses a copy of natural messenger RNA to produce immune response. It provides genetic codes for our cells to produce vital proteins , once the protein produce the body launch a immune response against the virus developing immunity. mRNA technique is very beneficial in future pandemics as it triggers our cells against viruses. Now the question is … How safe is this vaccine? 🤔 I think the safety of this vaccine can be concluded from the fact that recently two most powerful world leaders are vaccinated against covid 19 ‐ on camera.Joe Biden:- New president of United states of AmericaKamala Harris:- New lady Vice president of United states of America. Vaccinated with moderna vaccine. She said in his speech “ that she trust the vaccine and the scientist who created it\". So , I think we should have to trust on the vaccine and thus we can able to defeat this virus together.\n",

      "Answer:  During the vaccine trial, about half the volunteers got the vaccine. That is over 20,000 people. So far, no serious side effects have been attributed to the vaccine. So, in the study population and for the time post-vaccination covered by the trial (say about 2 months on average) the vaccine seems to be safe. We cannot know the long-term safety, because the disease has been around less than 12 months and the vaccine for a much shorter time. We cannot know if it is safe for everyone because the volunteers must have been screened and we do not know the inclusion criteria. However, I will get into line just as soon as it is available to people in my demographic. At worst, I will be a “volunteer” in a more extended stage 3 trial. At best, I and the people I interact with will be afforded some degree of protection against a deadly disease with horrible long-term morbidities. If there are long term safety issues, I am sure the medical research community will start tackling them as soon as they start to arise.\n",

If you don’t already know that you have reacted badly to a vaccine in the past then taking the vaccine will always be the safer choice.

      "Answer:  [Please note this question has been edited since I wrote this answer. The original question is in small faint grey text immediately above] Nothing can ever be proved completely safe. The right question here, is which do you take your chances with? The vaccine, or the virus? As far as I am aware, no vaccine has ever had consequences which only became apparent years later. There is no way to know yet about this one without a time machine. On the other hand several viruses do have such delayed consequences. Chickenpox can give rise to shingles, decades later. The Spanish flu sometimes caused Parkinson's disease, again decades later. ISTR reading there is a statistical link between measles in childhood and diabetes in later life. And any respiratory infection or chemical agent which scars your lungs, can blight your later life even if you do not notice it immediately after recovery. Severe Covid does cause such lung damage. Its effect on other organs may be just as bad. If you are young and healthy you might rationally decide to wait a few months while older people than yourself get vaccinated. They have more to fear from the virus. You can gain confidence if the vaccine causes hundreds of millions of them no great harm over a time scale of, say, six months. Waiting (say) a decade means it is very probable that the virus gets you first. Thalidomide revealed something that was either unknown or overlooked back then, that a developing foetus is extremely vulnerable to chemical influences. It was not a long term effect. The damage would have been apparent within weeks, had anybody looked, but it was revealed only months later when the babies were born. (Back then, looking would have meant high X ray doses which were known to be bad for babies and mothers alike). Since then all drugs have been intensively tested for teratogenic effects on a range of animals, and pregnant women are advised to avoid all medication not strictly necessary. Also many beverages and some foods. Incidentally Thalidomide - Wikipedia is back in use (prescription only!) since 1998, because it was and is very effective! Its obviously safe for men, and for women who cannot conceive. I don't know what is the medical/ethical attitude for fertile women who might benefit from taking it. Also incidentally, we vaccinate children against Rubella because it causes much the same as Thalidomide did if a woman catches it in early pregnancy. Otherwise its not a serious illness.\n",

      "Answer:  Thank you, my friend, for asking me to reply to your excellent question. I think it was due, in large part, to the global pandemic of horrific congenital birth defects at the use of Thalidomide that prompted the Food and Drug Administration to thoroughly test all medications…before those medications are allowed for public use. These vaccines have been urgently created, as the the mortality rate of this global pandemic is so pernicious. Yet, the FDA has publicly announced they will not allow any Covid-19 vaccine, that contains “side effects that prove to be troublesome.” Every vaccine in current use has completed three phases of clinical trials…under the direct oversight of the FDA, A minimum of thirty to fifty thousand human beings…volunteers, all of them…were injected with these vaccines, and carefully monitored for safety, and antibody development. The results of these clinical trials were submitted to the FDA for review, and hopefully approval. I attribute the rapidity of the creation of these vaccines to a number of factors. Governments of nations have poured countless hundreds of millions of dollars into Covid-19 research. I dare say…had that same amount of money been invested for the research of any other illness…we would witness the same spectacular results. Research scientists. immunologists, infectious disease experts, and molecular biologists are learning about viruses in general…and Covid-19 in particular…every hour. Think of knowledge as like building blocks our kids play with. One block is stacked upon another…then another…then another. We did not start at “Ground Zero”….when an attempt was made to create a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Medical science has been creating vaccines…ever since 1796…when Jenner created the first Small Pox vaccine. Scientists and medical professionals do not forget what has been learned…ever. They simply continue to add to their vast reservoir of knowledge…Just like kids with building blocks. Lastly, we need to acknowledge the significant contributions of the Computer…in greatly accelerating the research efforts. Tabulating results that used to take years…is done in only a few minutes. I agree with you, the formulation of Covid-19 vaccines have been rushed…with a dire sense of urgency. Yet, no “shortcuts” were taken. The safety and efficacy of each vaccine allowed for emergency use, has been carefully tested, monitored, and reviewed…before the first member of the general public was allowed to be inoculated. I promise you…the very minute they allow seventy-one year old men to be inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine…I hope to be first in line…with my shirt sleeve rolled up. I hope you have a wonderful new year, my friend.\n",

      "Answer:  I may not be qualified to answer this but I have always had an interest in the genetic code, back to my highschool days, when I wrote about the double helix, DNA, RNA and Watson and Crick. So with this in mind, what I can discern, is that; vaccines are not antibiotics. Antibiotics work on infections caused by organisms such as bacteria. Vaccines work on viruses. Viruses are not alive the have been thought of as being on the edge of life and chemistry. Viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Most are submicroscopic but all have a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses are not alive except for their DNA or RNA and one life process, which is reproduction. Viruses can't survive without a host. They are too small to fight cells, but they do attach themselves to cells and reprogram them to make new viruses until the cells burst and die, or until the cells turn malignant or cancerous. Covid-19 vaccines have mRNA in them, that will unzip your dna sphericals and forming infected cells that produce small proteins that fool your body's immune defense to produce certain antibodies. Virally infected cells produce and release small proteins called ‘interferons’, which play a role in immune protection against viruses. ‘Interferons’ prevent replication of viruses, by directly interfering with their ability to replicate within an infected cell. I believe that there are a lot of issues being disputed about whether the vaccines are safe and most seem to center around; whether or not the cell's natural ability, to recognize and defend against organisms, which produce disease, becomes compromised. One dispute centers around evidence that the Covid-19 Vaccine has caused cytokine storms in some people, that compromised their immune system, causing complications that are more deadly than the disease itself. A cytokine storm means a cell pathway has been turned on, leading to the production of a number of biological mediators (or signal transmitters) that cause changes to the body and interfere with normal cell function. Commonly, this means an excessive number of cytokines are released, which create high levels of inflammation, that can be fatal. Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong.\n",

      "Answer:  What are your thoughts on the Coronavirus/Covid vaccine? Is it safe right now? A few preliminary notes:There is no ‘the vaccine'. There are several currently in general use. The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson products are being distributed and administered based on an FDA issued emergency use authorization, which is not the same as FDA approval.Any thoughts I might have on the safety of any of the three vaccines listed above are irrelevant. We have phase 3 research data supporting the release of the vaccines based on their established safety and efficacy profiles.Finally, all medical interventions have an inherent risk/benefit ratio. Currently, that ratio falls heavily on the side of vaccination as soon as possible. Very heavily. Our ongoing phase 3 test/research data indicate that the above vaccines are among the cleanest, safest and most effective vaccines ever developed. Consider, please, the following: Contemporary vaccine tech has saved more lives and reduced more human suffering than all the advances of 20th century medicine combined. And one final note: Covid ain't safe, that's for certain. About 30 percent of those infected are dealing with long term sequelae including cardiomyopathy, renal function impairment, central nervous system issues and other problems. This is the sordid, hidden underbelly of the pandemic, and will ultimately prove more costly than the deaths\n",

      "Answer:  Is the corovavirus vaccine safe? Experimental coronavirus vaccine is safe and produces immune response Researchers are working to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Before a vaccine is available to the public, it must go through several stages of testing. The first stage is a Phase 1 clinical trial. In Phase 1, the vaccine is given to healthy volunteers to test if it’s safe and induces an immune response against the virus. Scientists began Phase 1 trials of an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 in mid-March. The vaccine, called mRNA-1273, is being co-developed by researchers at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the biotech company Moderna, Inc.The two-dose vaccine is designed to prompt the immune system to produce antibodies against a portion of the coronavirus “spike” protein, which the virus uses to bind to and enter human cells. The vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), a molecule critical for the virus to produce protein. The researchers, led by Dr. Lisa A. Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Seattle, published an interim report of the trial findings in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 14, 2020. The team tested the vaccine in 45 healthy adults, ages 18 to 55. Participants were enrolled at study sites in Seattle and Atlanta. The volunteers were divided into three groups. Each group received different doses of the vaccine (25, 100, or 250 micrograms). Participants received two injections, 28 days apart. After the second injection, the team evaluated how well the vaccine provoked an immune response against SARS-CoV-2. They also tested whether the antibodies could neutralize the virus in the laboratory. Safety was assessed throughout the trial as well. The investigational vaccine induced a strong immune response and was generally well tolerated. Antibody levels were higher with higher doses of the vaccine. In both the middle and high dose groups, the researchers observed high levels of neutralizing antibody activity through day 43 after the second injection. These levels were similar to the upper range found in patients who had recovered from COVID-19. None of the participants experienced serious side effects from the vaccine. However, more than half reported fatigue, headache, chills, or pain at the injection site. These symptoms were most common following the second vaccination and in those who received the highest vaccine dose. Based on side effects and immune response, the 100 microgram dose was chosen for an upcoming Phase 3 trial. The phase 1 trial is ongoing and currently has 120 participants. In April, researchers enrolled adults ages 55 years and older. A larger phase 2 clinical trial of mRNA-1273, sponsored by Moderna, began enrollment in late May. During this phase, researchers will continue to evaluate vaccine dosing and immune response. Plans are underway to launch a Phase 3 trial later this month to test the vaccine’s effectiveness in thousands of people. “Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” says NIAID Director Dr. Anthony S. Fauci. “The preliminary result of this trial is an important milestone toward this goal.”\n",

      "Answer:  There are several Covid-19 vaccines in development. Vaccines are as safe as the care taken in testing them prior to deploying them generally. Severe reactions to vaccines are rare but they occur, particularly when they are going to be applied to 100s of millions of healthy individuals. First, allergic people need to be aware if they have ever had an unacceptable reaction to a vaccine. Secondly, some of the people who will be vaccinated are in categories that could make them more vulnerable in general. Thirdly, the Covid-19 vaccines were developed rapidly and mistakes were made in phase 2 and 3 of some of the individual vaccines. One of these mistakes led serendipitously to discovering a better vaccine protocol. Another mistake led to a delay in the vaccines development. Safety, however was of primary interest. Vaccine development is proceeding through a paradigm shift using the mRNA paradigm and also using the viral vector paradigm, which has only been used in veterinary medicine successfully so far. Given these are all new vaccines to a new virus there is some risk from unknown aspects. However, these vaccines are all substantial technical advancements, and the safety of the procedures have been tested to the extent possible so far and the EUAs (Emergency Use Authorizations) are just that. These vaccines are meant to save lives, as vaccines in general are aimed. The primary desire of medicine is to “Do no harm”. All efforts in trying to defeat this current pandemic are following the dictum “Do no harm”. Doing nothing, not vaccinating, would be causing harm.\n",

      "Answer:  So far, for most people the results look good and we will have to see how things go. I hope and pray that they are able to test and prove a reasonable safety factor or alternative vaccine for those with severe allergic reactions, pregnant women, those under the age of 16, and those with compromised immune systems. I pray that all of the perfectly healthy anti-vaxxers who are lucky enough not to be in any of those groups pull their heads out of their asses and we can all get on with defeating this virus. I do think it is safe and will be lined up to get vaccinated just as soon as it is my turn.\n",

      "Answer:  People need to have fully informed consent when it comes to injecting foreign genetic material into their bodies. The COVID vaccines are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a completely new type of vaccine. No mRNA vaccine has ever been licensed for human use before. In essence, we have absolutely no idea what to expect from this vaccine. We have no idea if it will be effective or safe. Traditional vaccine simply introduce pieces of a virus to stimulate an immune reaction. The new mRNA vaccine is completely different. It actually injects (transfects) molecules of synthetic genetic material from non-humans sources into our cells. Once in the cells, the genetic material interacts with our transfer RNA (tRNA) to make a foreign protein that supposedly teaches the body to destroy the virus being coded for. Note that these newly created proteins are not regulated by our own DNA, and are thus completely foreign to our cells. What they are fully capable of doing is unknown. The mRNA molecule is vulnerable to destruction. So, in order to protect the fragile mRNA strands while they are being inserted into our DNA they are coated with PEGylated lipid nanoparticles. This coating hides the mRNA from our immune system which ordinarily would kill any foreign material injected into the body. PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been used in several different drugs for years. Because of their effect on immune system balance, several studies have shown them to induce allergies and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, PEGylated lipid nanoparticles have been shown to trigger their own immune reactions, and to cause damage to the liver. These new vaccines are additionally contaminated with aluminum, mercury, and possibly formaldehyde. The manufacturers have not yet disclosed what other toxins they contain. Since viruses mutate frequently, the chance of any vaccine working for more than a year is unlikely. That is why the flu vaccine changes every year. Last year’s vaccine is no more valuable than last year’s newspaper. Absolutely no long term safety studies will have been done to ensure that any of these vaccines don’t cause the cancer, seizures, heart disease, allergies, and autoimmune diseases seen with other vaccines. If you ever wanted to be guinea pig for Big Pharma, now is your golden opportunity. Many experts question whether the mRNA technology is ready for prime time. In November 2020, Dr. Peter Jay Hotez said of the new mRNA vaccines, “I worry about innovation at the expense of practicality because they [the mRNA vaccines] are weighted toward technology platforms that have never made it to licensure before.” Dr. Hotez is Professor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine, where he is also Director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. Michal Linial, PhD is a Professor of Biochemistry. Because of her research and forecasts on COVID-19, Dr. Linial has been widely quoted in the media. She recently stated, “I won’t be taking it [the mRNA vaccine] immediately – probably not for at least the coming year. We have to wait and see whether it really works. We will have a safety profile for only a certain number of months, so if there is a long-term effect after two years, we cannot know.” In November 2020, The Washington Post reported on hesitancy among healthcare professionals in the United States to the mRNA vaccines, citing surveys which reported that: “some did not want to be in the first round, so they could wait and see if there are potential side effects”, and that “doctors and nurses want more data before championing vaccines to end the pandemic”. Since the death rate from COVID resumed to the normal flu death rate way back in early September, the pandemic has been over since then. Therefore, at this point in time no vaccine is needed. The current scare tactics regarding “escalating cases” is based on a PCR test that because it exceeds 34 amplifications has a 100% false positive rate unless it is performed between the 3rd and 5th day after the first day of symptoms. It is therefor 100% inaccurate in people with no symptoms. This is well established in the scientific literature. See the attachment (False Positive PCR testing is up to 100%!) for more information on this. If you go to the CDC site (http://file:///C:/Users/docto/AppData/Local/Temp/cdc_97230_DS1.pdf ), you can see that the weekly death rates in the US are now lower than they normally are during an average flu season. The other reason you don’t need a vaccine for COVID-19 is that substantial herd immunity has already taken place in the United States. This is the primary reason for the end of the pandemic. Unfortunately, you cannot completely trust what you hear from the media. They have consistently got it wrong for the past year. Since they are all supported by Big Pharma and the other entities selling the COVID vaccines, they are not going to be fully forthcoming when it comes to mRNA vaccines. Every statement I have made here is fully backed by published scientific references. Anyone who after reading all this still wants to get injected with the mRNA vaccine, should at the very least have their blood checked for COVID-19 antibodies. There is no need for a vaccine in persons already naturally immunized. Updated additional information: 02/10/21 Could Spike Protein in Moderna, Pfizer Vaccines Cause Blood Clots, Brain Inflammation and Heart Attacks? • Children's Health Defense Could Spike Protein in Moderna, Pfizer Vaccines Cause Blood Clots, Brain Inflammation and Heart Attacks? In a more recent analysis published Feb. 4, 2021, in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke documented microvascular injury but no evidence of virus in the brains of patients who died from COVID-19. They reported, “In a convenience sample of patients who had died from COVID-19, multifocal microvascular injury was observed in the brain and olfactory bulbs by means of magnetic resonance microscopy, histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical analysis of corresponding sections, without evidence of viral infection.” If not viral infection, what else could be causing injury to distant organs associated with COVID-19? The most likely culprit that has been identified is the COVID-19 spike protein released from the outer shell of the virus into circulation. Research cited below has documented that the viral spike protein is able to initiate a cascade of events that triggers damage to distant organs in COVID-19 patients. Worryingly, several studies have found that the spike proteins alone have the capacity to cause widespread injury throughout the body, without any evidence of virus. What makes this finding so disturbing is that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer and currently being administered throughout the U.S. program our cells to manufacture this same coronavirus spike protein as a way to trigger our bodies to produce antibodies to the virus. According to Whelan’s letter to the FDA, the “Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is composed of an mRNA that produces a membrane-anchored full-length spike protein.” A landmark study in Nature Neuroscience, published a few days after Whelan’s letter, found that the commercially obtained COVID-19 spike protein (S1) injected into mice readily crossed the blood-brain barrier, was found in all 11 brain regions examined and entered the parenchymal brain space (the functional tissue in the brain). 02/05/21 501 Deaths + 10,748 Other Injuries Reported Following COVID Vaccine, Latest CDC Data These numbers reflect the latest data available as of Jan. 29 from the CDC’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website. Of the 501 reported deaths, 453 were from the U.S. The average age of those who died was 77, the youngest was 23. 501 Deaths + 10,748 Other Injuries Reported Following COVID Vaccine, Latest CDC Data Show • Children's Health Defense Look WHO’s Talking! Vaccine Scientists Confirm Major Safety Problems JANUARY 16, 2020 Look WHO’s Talking! Vaccine Scientists Confirm Major Safety Problems • Children's Health Defense Moderna Admits: mRNA Jabs Are an 'Operating System' Designed to Program Humans Pharmaceutical giant Merck said Monday {1/25/2021} that it was discontinuing the development of its two Covid-19 vaccine candidates. The studies showed that both candidates were generally well tolerated, But that the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection with Covid-19 and those reported for other Covid-19 vaccines Merck said in a statement posted on its website the decision to scrap the two vaccine candidates followed its review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies. The experimental injections being rolled out by Moderna and Pfizer are nothing similar to traditional vaccines. These mRNA platforms are an “operating system” designed to program human beings and turn their cells into efficient drug delivery systems. Drugmaker Merck discontinues two Covid-19 vaccine candidates January 5, 2021 The New American Magazine posted a video to playlist Interviews. In this explosive interview with Senior Editor Alex Newman of The New American magazine, former president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) Dr. Lee Merrit explains her belief that America is currently facing what appears to be biological warfare. Whether the Communist Chinese released the COVID19 virus on purpose or by accident is impossible to know, but the implications are enormous. When it comes to the new vaccines, Dr. Merrit, a former military doctor who studied biological warfare, goes through previous animal studies on the technology and paints a dire picture. However, even though modern medical schools do not often teach it, there are ways to treat viral infections that are time-tested and effective, she concludes.

      "Answer:  Covid-19 Vaccine:COVID-19 vaccine is finally here and, you can say the wait is over. No, matter how much we cover our faces and wash hands frequently, we need a vaccine to fight this pandemic. But wait, do you know about the results, side effects, and precautions of the most awaited vaccines? The trials of the vaccine have already started. But, before taking a vaccine, one should know everything about it. The first question people have – is the vaccine safe? Let’s know about the vaccine in detail. Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?The primary concern is whether it is safe to take the COVID-19 vaccine or not. The objective of the world vaccine system is to ensure that all the vaccines are safe and effective. Safety is indeed the priority while manufacturing the vaccine. Trial and Testing – All the vaccines go under testing to test the effectiveness and safety. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set up standards to know about vaccine safety. According to the National Institute of Health, one vaccine should pass the four phases before it is used, for the public. As per the UK for the Pfizer-BioNTech, almost 40,000 volunteers were hired by the government for the trial. Half of the people have given the vaccine and the other half placebo jab. Authorization – In the United States, FDA approved vaccines can be released in 1 public for emergency use authorization. The EUA gives temporary allowance to use vaccines in emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. Monitoring the Results and Side-Effects – The government has asked all the vaccine manufactured companies to keep track of the results of the vaccine. There might be side effects that did not get noticed during the trials. FDA and CDC are expanding their vaccine monitoring work so they can find the side-effects and results early. How Effective are the COVID-19 Vaccines?It’s natural to wonder if the vaccines against the coronavirus are effective or not. The overall effectiveness report of the vaccines is 75% to 95%.Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine trial involves almost 44,000 people. The vaccine is 95% effective and authorized to use in the United States.Moderna Vaccine trial involves 30,000 volunteers and is 94% effective. It is allowed to be used in the US.AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine trial showed 70% results on the usage of the full dose. However, it showed 90% results on using a half dose. This vaccine is allowed to be used for Great Britain.Johnsson and Jhonson vaccine trial has experienced 66% effectiveness and wants authorization for the US.Final Words! People are concerned and scared before taking the COVID-19 vaccination. The primary concern is whether the COVID-19 vaccine is safe or not. Many rumors are spreading out there related to the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. Before believing anything blindly, one should check all the facts. However, different vaccines are under development and ready for trial. I hope this year we will kill this coronavirus. For more health-related information, follow Health Club Finder.
